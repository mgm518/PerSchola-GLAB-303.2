# Lesson 303.2 - Java Programming Fundamentals

This consists of the practice assignments 303.2.1 - Variables, 303.2.2 - Scanner Class, and 303.2.3 - Operators and Numbers.

~ 303.2.2 does request submitting a link to one's HackerRank profile, which I did.  For convenience, I added screenshots of the code submissions and their results in this repo.  The project also has copy of the code used for the submission in the project.
